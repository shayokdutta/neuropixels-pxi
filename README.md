# Shay's modification to integrate a standalone RippleDetectorUI
Ripple detector upgraded from old Trodes dev. This is now a standalone module that should interface both with Trodes and Neuropixels PXIe --> Open Ephys data. 

UPGRADES! NPX --> my module as well as loading the NPX data from the probe to the buffer that's sent to OE is now vectorized. This is done with AVX instructions similar to the Trodes handling of Neuropixels data. Objectively this will cause a speedup and minimize closed-loop latency. How much though? I'm unsure I'll quantify it soon enough.

RippleDetectorUI binaries are included in the module. Docs and usage will be provided later but this is expected to only work on Windows with Neuropixels. Intan interface on Linux with Trodes should work as well once this is finalized fully. I do want to maintain Spikegadgets/Trodes support for the Neuropixels headstage as well eventually but alas I don't hav ethe hardware.

# Neuropixels PXI Plugin

![Hardware diagram](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/_images/neuropix-pxi-01.png)

This plugin makes it possible to stream Neuropixels data from a PXI-based acquisition system into the [Open Ephys GUI](https://github.com/open-ephys/plugin-gui).

## Installation

This plugin is not included by default, but must be added via the GUI's Plugin Installer. To access the Plugin Installer, press **ctrl-P** from inside the GUI. Once the installer is loaded, browse to the "Neuropix-PXI" plugin, and click "Install."

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you will need to close and re-open the GUI before you can use the plugin in a signal chain.

## Usage

Instructions for using the Neuropixels PXI plugin are available [here](https://open-ephys.github.io/gui-docs/User-Manual/Plugins/Neuropixels-PXI.html).

## Hardware requirements
